- For this assignment in week 3, I used several resources to help me understand Node.js and create this project. I used a combination of the slides posted in Canvas, articles explaining Node.js, explanations from AI, and YouTube videos. I'll post the links to those below as well as a link to the chatlogs from ChatGPT.

- package.json
    - package.json is a file that exists in the node project that lists project information and describes aspects of it. Information included in this file are things like the name, dependencies, scripts, and project configuration. The command npm init -y will create a package.json file and fill it with default values. The entry file, or "main", tells Node where to start, in this case, it is "index.js".

- process.env
    - In Node.js, process.env is a global object. It holds the environment variables for the current process by using key/value pairs. The keys are the environment variable names and the values are the corresponding strings. The process.env object enables developers to access environment variables such as URLs and API keys without having to hard code them.

- npm start
    - When you run npm start, npm finds the "start" script and then runs it. So if you have a section in package.json that says "start", npm will run whatever script is defined there.

- Thankfully, I encountered no real issues when creating this node project. It may be the first time in history where I did not face major issues.
